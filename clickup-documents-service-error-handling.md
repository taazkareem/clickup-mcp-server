# Question: Error Handling Pattern in DocumentService

## Context

While reviewing the my `DocumentService` implementation for ClickUp (in `src/services/clickup/document.ts`), I noticed that, originally, I was not using `handleError` method for error handling. Instead, I was relying on wrapping logic with `makeRequest`, which is a pattern used in the base service class.

However, other ClickUp service modules (such as `TaskServiceCore`, `FolderService`, `ListService`, and `WorkspaceService`) consistently use a pattern where each public method is wrapped in a `try/catch` block, and errors are passed to a `handleError` method that standardizes error formatting and propagation (usually throwing a `ClickUpServiceError`).

## Action Taken

To ensure consistency and clarity across the codebase, the `DocumentService` was refactored to:
- Add a private `handleError` method, following the same structure as other services.
- Wrap each public method in a `try/catch` block, and throw errors using `handleError`.
- Import `ClickUpServiceError` and `ErrorCode` from `./base.js`, as is done in other services.

## Question

**Is this the preferred and recommended error handling pattern for all ClickUp service modules?**

- Should all service methods use explicit `try/catch` and a `handleError` method, even if the base class provides a `makeRequest` utility?
- Or is it acceptable for some services to rely solely on `makeRequest` for error handling?

This note is to document the decision and to clarify the intended standard for future maintenance. 

TL;DR: Isn't this redundant?
