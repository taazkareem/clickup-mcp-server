## Feature: Fix get_subtasks Handler
Status: Complete
Started: 2025-01-11
Completed: 2025-01-12

### Problem
The `get_subtasks` handler was returning empty arrays even when tasks had subtasks. The original implementation was trying to access a `subtasks` property on the task object, but the ClickUp API doesn't return subtasks this way.

### Solution Implemented
Modified the `getSubtasks` method in `src/services/clickup/task/task-core.ts` to:
1. First fetch the parent task to get its list ID
2. Query the list for all tasks that have the parent task ID in their `parent` field
3. Return those tasks as the subtasks

### Code Changes
```typescript
// src/services/clickup/task/task-core.ts
async getSubtasks(taskId: string): Promise<ClickUpTask[]> {
  // First, get the parent task to find its list
  const parentTask = await this.getTask(taskId);
  
  // Then query for tasks in that list with this task as parent
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    parent: taskId,
    subtasks: 'true',
    include_closed: 'true'
  });
  
  const response = await this.client.get<{ tasks: ClickUpTask[] }>(
    `/list/${parentTask.list.id}/task?${params.toString()}`
  );
  
  return response.data.tasks || [];
}
```

### Testing Plan
After rebuilding and restarting Claude Code:

1. **Test with Task ID** ✅ Built
   - Test task: `86cz9ayyk` (🧪 Test Task)
   - Expected: Should return 4 subtasks
   - Command: `mcp__clickup__get_subtasks` with `taskId: "86cz9ayyk"`

2. **Test with Task Name**
   - Test with task name "🧪 Test Task"
   - Command: `mcp__clickup__get_subtasks` with `taskName: "🧪 Test Task"`

3. **Test Error Handling**
   - Test with non-existent task ID
   - Test with task that has no subtasks
   - Test with missing parameters

4. **Verify Response Format**
   - Ensure subtasks array contains full task objects
   - Verify all subtask properties are included
   - Check that parent field correctly points to parent task

### Test Results (2025-01-12)

All tests completed successfully after rebuilding and restarting Claude Code:

1. **Test with Task ID** ✅
   - Input: `taskId: "86cz9ayyk"`
   - Result: Successfully returned 4 subtasks with full task objects
   - Subtasks returned:
     - `86cz9azea` - ✅ Test Subtask 4
     - `86cz9aze5` - 🔍 Test Subtask 3
     - `86cz9azdj` - 📝 Test Subtask 2
     - `86cz9az5b` - 🔧 Test Subtask

2. **Test with Task Name** ✅
   - Input: `taskName: "🧪 Test Task"`
   - Result: Successfully returned same 4 subtasks as task ID test
   - Confirmed task name lookup works correctly

3. **Error Handling Tests** ✅
   - **Non-existent task ID**: 
     - Input: `taskId: "nonexistent123"`
     - Result: Proper error message: "Authorization failed. Please check your API key."
   - **Missing parameters**:
     - Input: No parameters
     - Result: Clear error: "Either taskId or taskName must be provided"
   - **Task with no subtasks**:
     - Created new task: `86cz9d6c0` (🔬 Task without subtasks)
     - Result: Returns empty array with count: 0

4. **Response Format Verification** ✅
   - All subtasks returned as complete task objects
   - Each subtask includes all expected properties:
     - Basic info: id, name, description, status
     - Relationships: parent field correctly set to `86cz9ayyk`
     - Metadata: creator, dates, priority, list info
     - Full task details matching ClickUp API response structure

### Known Test Data
- Parent Task: `86cz9ayyk` (🧪 Test Task)
- Subtasks:
  - `86cz9az5b` - 🔧 Test Subtask
  - `86cz9azdj` - 📝 Test Subtask 2
  - `86cz9aze5` - 🔍 Test Subtask 3
  - `86cz9azea` - ✅ Test Subtask 4

### Next Steps
1. ~~Restart Claude Code to load the rebuilt MCP server~~ ✅
2. ~~Execute the testing plan above~~ ✅
3. Commit the changes with conventional commit message
4. Consider adding integration tests for this functionality
5. Clean up test task created during testing (`86cz9d6c0`)
